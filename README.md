# Ruby on Rails - Authentication - Project: Members Only!
> This project is part of the Microverse Full-Stack development program through The Odin Project.
> It's an implementation of a simple Ruby on Rails project, using Devise for handling the user authentication logic, and tailoring the user model to work with our own user posts model. We've had to put in practice our skills in Active Record models, migrations and references between models.
